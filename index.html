					<p>My name is Oliver Heib and I come from town called Bury in Greater Manchester. I have many hobbies and interests which have allowed me to develop various skills, such as communication, leadership, team work and problem solving and to demonstrate my reliability, commitment and motivation. For example, I have completed two Duke of Edinburgh Awards and in order to achieve these I had to show I was independent and had great self-awareness.</p>

					<h2>My Life</h2>
					<br>
					<p>I was born in Manchester on the Second of February 1999 and went to St Andrews primary school. After this I went on to study my GCSEs at Woodhey High School where I took Computer Science as I was always interested in computers and the concept of being able to control them exited me. I then continued to study computer science at A-Level along with Maths and Physics. I am currently studying a computer science degree at Manchester Metropolitan University. I enjoy programming in particular from the computing courses as I enjoy making quicker and easier ways for the program to run and making it so the user has less to do but still have a variety of options to choose during using the program.</p>				
						
					<p>Outside of education I have hobbies such as scouts and kayaking. I have joined societies for both of these and I am currently organizing a river trip for the first time kayakers in the group. I have been in scouts since I was 6 and joined beavers. Throughout my time in scouts I have completed many challenges. Such as the Pike View hike, which is an annual hike where scouts come from all over the country to compete. I have entered this event nearly every year. Other challenges I have completed are the bronze silver and gold awards where you have to complete every challenge badge in that section of scouting (in beavers cubs and scouts respectively). During explorer I completed the Explorer belt where I had to walk 100 miles across a country I have never been to.</p>
