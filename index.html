		<h1><p>7 By 7</p></h1>
		<p>7by7 is a comic that focuses on a set of characters that I have had for a while but never knew what to do with them. Recently I started reading The Walking Dead and decided that was what I wanted to use the characters for, a comic. 2 other big influences for my comic are the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy as this is one of my favourite books (and the reason the comic is Si-Fi) and the music I listen two. All the volumes are named after some of my favourite songs. The first volume being Leaving Here.</p><p>The story of 7by7 focuses on Coda the son of the Master of the Universe. Coda disagrees with the way his dad is running the universe. With tension building up between them, Coda leaves home to explore the universe and to get as far away from his father's influence as possible but on his journey he crosses path with some unfriendly folk.</p>

		<h1>Fheohs</h1>

		<p>Fheohs is a project that started out as a mod for Fallout 4. Originally it was set in Arizona. It included Phoenix as the major city as well as Two Sons and all the way to Nogales on the border. The map also went up to Flagstaff, the capital of Caesar's Legion. I ended up designing a lot of the map and characters but trying to put a set of characters (the same ones from my comic) I found the world didn't fit the same story and would have to be set so far after Fallout 4, so that there were non of the same factions, it didnâ€™t feel worth putting it in the same world. I then tried to make Fheohs (after designing a few things about the world) in a Skyrim mod but changed to making it in unity because of engine limitations. (converting to their model file format is a bit of a hassle.)</p>			<p>Fheohs is set in a Fantasy universe with the same basic history as my comic. Gods exist and each month is named after one. The Regini (who currently own Qwed, Uert, Rater) are trying to expand and own the whole world. The rest of the countries in the north west of the word have formed an alliance to fight back against the Regini. The main goal of this project is to create a Morowind-esk experiance focusing more on the characters and the players interaction with them rather than amazing graphics. Letting the player create their own story rather than the game presenting them with one.</p>
