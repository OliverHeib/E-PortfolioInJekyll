					<p>I was born in Manchester in 1999. I went on to study my GCSEs at High School where I took Computer Science as I was always interested in computers and the concept of being able to control them exited me. I then continued to study computer science at A-Level along with Maths and Physics. I am currently studying a computer science degree at Manchester Metropolitan University. I enjoy programming in particular from the computing courses as I enjoy making quicker and easier ways for the program to run and making it so the user has less to do but still have a variety of options to choose during using the program.</p>				
						
					<p>Hobbies such as scouts and kayaking. I am currently the Vice Chair or the MMU Canoe whair I mainly organize river trips for the club introducing first time kayakers to white water. Throughout my time in scouts I have completed many challenges. Such as the Pike View hike, which is an annual hike where scouts come from all over the country to compete. I have entered this event nearly every year. Other challenges I have completed are the bronze silver and gold awards where you have to complete every challenge badge in that section of scouting (in beavers cubs and scouts respectively). During explorer I completed the Explorer belt where I had to walk 100 miles across a country I have never been to. I am also working on a comic for a set of character I have been working on for a while now and a game in Unity inspired by one of my favorite games Morrowind.</p>
