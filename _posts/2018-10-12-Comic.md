Recently I decided to start a comic.
Currently just getting the characters sorted out. This a wip of the first page of the first issue.

The characters started out in a fallout 4 mod set in Arizona. After realising I wanted to focus more on the characters I decided to make something for them in their own universe. After reading The Walking Dead I decided a comic would best suit the story. I will probably eventually make a game equivalent but for the moment I want to focus on the characters.
These are th two main characters as I currently invisen them. 
Coda Radel and Jake Reih.
