I have been currently working on the script for the first issue and I am aiming to get it finished by the end of the month so I can draw the issue over Christmas. Hopefully releasing the issue some time next year. This is a WIP of Coda's brother Jack in the style I have finaly chosen for the comics

Working on the story for the first volume I have decided to create a mod for Fallout NV set on the planet Coda will go to during the volume. The planet is called Ogfi and is far into the pirate district in the galaxy with not to friendly characters for Coda to meet. My hoping with this is to get a better feel on the world the volume takes place in to make the volume more believable and interesting to read.
