    <h1><p>7 By 7</p></h1>
    <p>7by7 is a comic that focuses on a set of characters that I have had for a while but never knew what to do with them. Recently I started reading The Walking Dead and decided that was what I wanted to use the characters for, a comic. 2 other big influences for my comic are the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy as this is one of my favourite books (and the reason the comic is Si-Fi) and the music I listen two. All the volumes are named after some of my favourite songs. The first volume being Leaving Here.</p>
    <p>The story of 7by7 focuses on Coda the son of the Master of the Universe. Coda disagrees with the way his dad is running the universe. With tension building up between them, Coda leaves home to explore the universe and to get as far away from his father's influence as possible but on his journey he crosses path with some unfriendly folk.</p>
