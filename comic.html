<h1>My Comic 7by7</h1>
<p>7by7 is a comic that focuses on a set of characters that I have had for a while but never knew what to do with them. Recently I started reading The Walking Dead and decided that was what I wanted to use the characters for, a comic. 2 other big influences for my comic are the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy as this is one of my favourite books (and the reason the comic is Si-Fi) and the music I listen two. All the volumes are named after some of my favourite songs. The first volume being Leaving Here.</p>
